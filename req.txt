“Interactive Prompt Playground”
Objective:

Build a user-configurable prompt playground where a user can: Create a prompt that outputs a product description for a given item (e.g., iPhone, Tesla, running shoes). Now run it with varying:

Parameter	Test Values
temperature	0.0, 0.7, 1.2
max_tokens	50, 150, 300
presence_penalty	0.0, 1.5
frequency_penalty	0.0, 1.5
Select the model (gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4)
Input system prompt and user prompt
Adjust:
Temperature
Frequency Penalty
Presence Penalty
Stop Sequence
Deliverable:

A grid/table showing all outputs
2-paragraph reflection on what changed and why

Your project must include:

The playground code (script or web UI).

A README.md with:

How to run the playground
Description of features (parameter control, model selection, etc.)
A grid/table showing outputs across different settings.

A 2-paragraph reflection explaining how and why the responses changed with different parameters.

Ensure the app/script runs without errors and avoids exposing API keys.
